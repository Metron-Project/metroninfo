# MetronInfo.xml

## What is it?

`MetronInfo.xml` is an attempt to create a new schema for digital comic books that fixes some of the problems with `ComicInfo.xml`.

## Rationale

Other sources of informations (GCD, League of Comic Geeks, Metron) provide more data than Comic Vine, and it would be nice to have an XML Schema to handle it.

## Where can I find the schemas?
